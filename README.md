# Our Land: Public Land Policy Tracker

**Our Land** is a professional-grade field guide and policy tracker designed for the modern conservationist. It monitors the Federal Register in real-time to visualize industrial threats (mining, logging, drilling) and conservation efforts across U.S. public lands. As an environmentalist and avid outdoorsman myslef, I wanted to create this so that people like me can stay in the loop with how the government is affecting the land that we use for recreation. Additionally, for people who don't take advantage of the beauty of our public lands, Our Land serves as a way to get people interested and invested in the protection of our land.

Using a minimalist "Patagonia-inspired" aesthetic, the app transforms dense government documents into an interactive, topographic map experience.

##  What It Does
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Fetches the latest filings from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Forest Service (USFS), and National Park Service (NPS).
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Uses LLMs to parse legalese into plain English, determining the "Impact Level" and "Category" of each event.
- **Geospatial Visualization:** Maps specific policy coordinates onto an Esri Shaded Relief terrain map.
- **Protected Land Overlays:** Displays National Park boundaries (GeoJSON) to provide context for nearby industrial permits.
